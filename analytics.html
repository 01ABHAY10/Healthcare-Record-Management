                Comparison of Cancer Cases Based on Lifestyle Choices
              </h3>
              <p class="card-text">
                <b>Description:</b><br />
                This grouped bar plot presents a comparison of the number of
                people suffering from cancer and those who are not, based on
                their lifestyle choices. The bars are categorized according to
                different combinations of drinking, smoking, and tobacco
                consumption. The bars on the left represent individuals who do
                not engage in any of these behaviors (non-drinkers, non-smokers,
                and non-tobacco users). The bars on the right represent
                individuals who participate in one or more of these habits.<br />
                By examining this grouped bar plot, we can gain valuable
                insights into the relationship between lifestyle choices and
                cancer incidence. It is essential to note that these findings
                are based on the specific data set used for this analysis.
                Remember, interpreting the results should consider various
                factors, such as sample size, demographics, and potential
                confounding variables.

                <b>Description:</b><br />The pie chart represents the

                Distribution of Disease Burden Among Individuals.
              </h3>
              <p class="card-text">
                <b>Description:</b><br />
                The bar plot represents the distribution of disease burden among
                individuals, showcasing the number of people suffering from
                different numbers of diseases. The x-axis indicates the number
                of diseases, ranging from 0 to 6, while the y-axis represents
                the number of people.<br />

                <b>Insights:</b><br />

                Most Common Scenario: The majority of individuals in the
                study/sample do not suffer from any diseases, as reflected by
                the highest bar representing zero diseases. Gradual Decline: As
                the number of diseases increases, the number of people affected
                decreases progressively, indicating a decline in the prevalence
                of multiple diseases. Prevalence of Single Diseases: The bar
                representing one disease shows a notable count, suggesting that
                a significant portion of individuals in the study/sample are
                affected by a single disease. Rare Cases: The bars representing
                individuals with two to six diseases demonstrate a steady
                decrease, indicating that individuals affected by multiple
                diseases simultaneously are relatively rare.

                The pie chart provides an overview of the distribution of
                individuals suffering from acute and chronic diseases within our
                study population. Acute diseases are characterized by a sudden
                onset and short duration, while chronic diseases persist over
                the long term. This visual representation helps us understand
                the relative proportions of these disease types and their impact
                on the population.
                <br /><b>Definitions:</b><br />
                Acute Diseases: Conditions that have a rapid onset and a short
                duration. They typically require immediate medical attention and
                can resolve within a few days or weeks.
                <br />Chronic Diseases: Long-term conditions that persist over
                an extended period, often for years or a lifetime. They usually
                progress slowly and may require ongoing medical management.

                Analysis of COVID-19 Vaccine Dosage and Effectiveness
              </h3>
              <p class="card-text">
                <b>Description:</b><br />
                The grouped bar plot presented here provides a comprehensive
                visualization of the COVID-19 vaccine dosages administered to
                individuals, categorizing them into four groups: no dose, first
                dose, second dose, and booster dose. Additionally, the plot
                distinguishes between individuals who have contracted COVID-19
                and those who remain COVID-free, enabling a clear assessment of
                vaccine effectiveness.<br />
                <b>Insights:</b><br />
                The plot illustrates the distribution of vaccine dosages,
                indicating the number of individuals in each category (no dose,
                first dose, second dose, booster dose) and their COVID-19
                status. It allows for a clear assessment of vaccine
                effectiveness by comparing the proportions of COVID-positive and
                COVID-negative individuals within each dosage category. The plot
                shows the progression of vaccine administration, from
                individuals without any doses to those receiving subsequent
                doses. Trends in vaccine uptake and effectiveness can be
                identified by comparing multiple plots over different time
                periods. The plot provides valuable information for
                decision-making regarding vaccine distribution and public health
                strategies.
